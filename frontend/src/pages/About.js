                I’m a full-stack developer with a focus on crafting clean, responsive, and intuitive web apps.
                I enjoy solving complex problems with elegant, efficient code — whether that’s in Java with Spring Boot
                or JavaScript with React and Vue.
            </p>
            <p className="about-text">
                My approach is collaborative, detail-oriented, and always evolving — I love learning new technologies
                and refining my workflow to create meaningful digital experiences.
            </p>
